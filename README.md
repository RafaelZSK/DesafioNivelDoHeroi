# Desafio de Projeto: Classificador de Nível de Herói 🐱‍👤

## Description 📜
This code was created to apply, in practice, the concepts learned in the 'Mastering Control Structures' module, where topics such as conditional, decision, and repetition structures were covered.

The challenge is to create a hero level classifier, where the input data includes the hero's name and the amount of experience (xp), and the output is the hero's level.
